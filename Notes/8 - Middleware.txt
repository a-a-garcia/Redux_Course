1 - Intro 

Middleware is the building block that allows us to run side effects, such as calling APIs.

2 - What is Middleware?

When dispatching actions, we're sending them through a single entry point.

Once it reaches the root reducer, it will be passed down to the appropriate child reducer

In this pipeline, we can add functions that would get executed every time an action is dispatched. This is what we call middleware because it sits in the middle.

So in Redux, middleware is code that is executed after an action is dispatched, but before it reaches the reducer.

*Calling APIs,
*Error reporting
*Analytics
*Authorization

3 - Creating Middleware
go to store/middleware

4 - Parameterizing Middleware
go to configureStore

5 - Dispatching Functions
Remember that in Redux, actions should be plain objects with a type property.

go to index.js

We can give the store the ability to dispatch functions by giving it a middleware function
