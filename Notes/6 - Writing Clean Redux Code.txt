2 - Structuring Files and Folders

we've structured our files like thus so Faster

src/
    actions.js
    actionTypes.js
    reducer.js

We want all of these files inside a folder called store. Our state management code should be completely isolated from our UI/presentation code. Separation of concerns

src/
    store/
        actions.js
        actionTypes.js
        reducer.js

We should also group files by feature. Each sub-domain should have its own actions, action types and reducer.
src/
    store/
        feature/
            actions.js
            actionTypes.js
            reducer.js
        auth/
            actions.js
            actionTypes.js
            reducer.js
        bugs/
        projects/

There is also the "Ducks" pattern, where action types, actions and the reducer for a specific domain is bundled into a duck - like `auth.js

src/
    store/
        auth.js
        bugs.js
        project.js

3 - Ducks Pattern
go to src/store

some rules for ducks
 1. Your reducer must be an `export default`
 2. you need to `export` each individual action creators (ie bugAdded)
 3. no need to `export` action types as they should only be used in that duck

4 - Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is a library that helps simplify your redux code - has a lot of helper functions

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit (or look at official doc as the command may change)

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit@1.2.5 (for this course)

5 - Creating the Store
go to src/store/configureStore.js

6 - Creating actions
go to src/store/bugs.js

7 - Creating Reducers
go to src/store/bugs.js

8 - Creating Slices
go to src/store/bugs.js

In Redux Toolkit, there is `createSlice` which is a function automatically creates actions and a reducer for us.
